<p>The Online Medieval Sources Bibliography provides detailed information about modern editions - both in print and online - 
of medieval primary sources.  Our goal is to help users find the editions that are most suited to their needs.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Teachers and Professors</b>: find the best texts and editions to assign to your students</li>
		<li><b>Students of all levels</b>: find the best texts and editions for your research projects</li>
		<li><b>Enthusiasts</b>: find the best texts and editions to learn more about your favorite topics</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>For all texts, we provide more information than you can find in a typical library catalog, such as:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Best Audience</b>: whether the edition is appropriate for high school students, graduate students, or someone in between</li>
		<li><b>Background Information</b>: how this edition relates to other editions, how it is viewed by the scholarly community</li>
		<li><b>Scholarly Apparatus</b>: not just indexes and appendices, but bibliographies, glossaries, facsimiles, and introductions</li>
	</ul>
